# Vat we svore
#### CHARTER:
```
We have stand-ups at 9:42 every day.
We will endeavour to have a laugh.
We commit in the present tense.
We use sensible, informative commit messages.
We review any issues as they arise.
We definitely have retros at 6PM, or 5PM in the event that someone is leaving early.
We actively rotate the leaders of retros and stand-ups.
We will have lunch/drinks together at some point (and we will not talk about code)
We respect that we all have lives outside of coding.
Well-being of team members comes first.
```
